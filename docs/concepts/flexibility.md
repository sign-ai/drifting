# Flexibility

The ease of use is in the heart of **drifting** package. We believe MLops
is a culture of work and as a young field it still requires a lot of expertise.
However, providing the easiest tools, that can be used in various scenarios, is
a good fundamental for future

**Drift Detection Server** is a single server that can be used in many purposes.
The possible scenarios are presented in [Usage Scenarios](). The same server
can be used by many projects, many features, many kinds of drifts. The drift
detectors can be overwritten, and trained on the fly, or loaded from a file.
On the other hand, DDS can also be deployed many times, separately for each
project.
